| **include_expanded_results** | **Boolean** | When a shopper uses an ambiguous or a multi-word search phrase, they can get an empty response. After turning on include expanded results, Retail Search analyzes the request and returns the expanded list of products based on the parsed search query. For example, if you search \&quot;Google Pixel 5\&quot; without query expansion, you might only get \&quot;google_pixel_5\&quot; in the result. With query expansion, you might get \&quot;google_pixel_4a_with_5g\&quot;, \&quot;google_pixel_4a\&quot; and \&quot;google_pixel_5_case\&quot; as well.The default value is configured in the tenant settings or true if there is no such setting | [optional] |

Values above 300 will be coerced to 300.  If this field is negative, an INVALID_ARGUMENT is returned.  This limit (300) is configured on Google side, but Google have an ability to change it for specific project.  | [optional] |
| **login_id** | **String** | Highly recommended for logged-in users. Unique identifier for logged-in user, such as a user name. Don&#39;t set for anonymous users.  Don&#39;t set the field to the same fixed ID for different users. This mixes the event history of those users together, which results in degraded model quality.  The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters.  | [optional] |
| **overwrites** | [**SearchRequestDtoOverwrites**](SearchRequestDtoOverwrites.md) |  | [optional] |
